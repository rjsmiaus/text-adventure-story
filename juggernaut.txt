The center cave mouth has been adorned with a single blue warbanner hanging from the ceiling and sprawled across walls. The banner has a crest in the shape of a blue lance, and its edges are worn from unfurling.
	Inside, you tread through some rocky waterbed to reach a lake. Despite the lake's still surface, the sound of moving water echoes off the cave walls. Stalactites shimmer in the lake's reflection. You can see the bottom of the lake, and resignedly wades into the freezing water to cross. On the other side, the cave expands to the sight of a moving waterfall, the origin of the noise. You can see light behind the thin veil of water.
	A man in grey plate armor crashes through the waterfall before Player can move. His blue cape is drenched, and his helmet glistens with water droplets.
	"I am Sir Komesision, Knight of Spearhead Mountain. You are trespassing on land under my protection!‚Äù.
	The self-proclaimed knight holds an steel lance in one hand and a teardrop shield in the other. The shield has a depiction of a blue dragon on its shiny surface and a sculpted brass border. The lancer bangs his shield on the ground as an invitation for battle.
	You raise your sword to defend yourself.
	The knight gurgles inside his dented helmet, slick with blood. He makes a feeble attempt to charge at you again with his shield but his strength fails him and he flops to the ground with a jolting thud of steel on rock. Sir Komesision gives an eerie sigh beneath his heavy armor before he dies.
